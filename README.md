# cellular-automaton.nvim
A useless plugin that might help you cope with stubbornly broken tests or overall lack of sense in life. It let's you execute aesthetically pleasing, cellular automaton animations based on the content of neovim buffer.



## What is cellular automata
From the [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton):

> A cellular automaton is a model used in computer science and mathematics. The idea is to model a dynamic system by using a number of cells. 
> Each cell has one of several possible states. With each "turn" or iteration the state of the current cell is determined by two things: 
> its current state, and the states of the neighbouring cells.

## But.. why?


## Requirements
- neovim >= 0.8
- nvim-treesitter plugin

## Implement your own cellular automaton logic!
