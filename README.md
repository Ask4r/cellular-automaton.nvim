## What is celluar automata
From the [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton):

> A cellular automaton is a model used in computer science and mathematics. The idea is to model a dynamic system by using a number of cells. 
> Each cell has one of several possible states. With each "turn" or iteration the state of the current cell is determined by two things: 
> its current state, and the states of the neighbouring cells.
